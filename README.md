# twit-battle
my twit-battle project made with my teamate for school. this project allows user to retrieve two characters from either twitter api or uploading their own.  then they gain att/hp based on the twitter account's followers or their number of tweets. after each battle the loser gets eliminated and the winner would gain the loser's stats.
